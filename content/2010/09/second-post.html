This entry is the third in my series describing various [Mercurial][] workflows.
The [first][branch-as-needed] describes the simplest one: branching only when
necessary, and the [second][default-and-stable] describes the classic "default
and stable" workflow.

I've been experimenting with another workflow lately and it's proven itself to
be pretty useful, so I wanted to write about it.
